The next section contains the functions needed to perform the CRUD operations. The createContacts() function takes in the name, email and message of the contact to be created and uses the queryString variable to build a SQL query to insert the data into the contacts table. The readContacts() function uses a queryString to select all the records from the contacts table and console.log() them. The updateContacts() function takes in the name, email, message and id of the contact to be updated and uses the queryString variable to build the SQL UPDATE query. Finally, the deleteContacts() function takes in the id of the contact to be deleted and uses the queryString variable to build the SQL DELETE query. 

The last part of the code exports the functions so they can be used in other files. 

Overall, this code provides a set of functions that can be used to perform CRUD operations on a MySQL database.
